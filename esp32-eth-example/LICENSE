Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work
of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without
fear of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in
other works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial
purposes.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or
she is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under
its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those
rights.

This work is provided as-is with no warranty of any kind. The author(s)
disclaim all liability for any consequences arising from the use of this
software.
